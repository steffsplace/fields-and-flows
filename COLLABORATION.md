# Collaboration

I’m open to collaboration with a small number of people interested in:
- electrodynamics and field-based systems
- experimental physics and measurement
- vortex flows and fluid mechanics
- control and automation for physical systems

## Working principles
- classical physics
- reproducible experiments
- clear documentation
- open, respectful discussion

## Not in scope
- non-physical “free energy” claims
- projects without measurement or falsification

If you’re interested, open an issue describing:
1) your background
2) what you’d like to explore
3) what tools or skills you bring
