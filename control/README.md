# Control & Automation

This section documents control strategies, automation logic, and feedback
systems developed within the Open Physics Lab.

The focus lies on designing, implementing, and validating control mechanisms
that connect physical processes with computational decision-making and
automation infrastructure.

---

## Scope

This area covers control theory in practice and its application to physical,
electrical, and energy-related systems.

Topics include feedback control, real-time data processing, automation
architectures, and integration with measurement and actuation hardware.

---

## Core Areas of Interest

- feedback and closed-loop control systems  
- automation workflows and orchestration  
- real-time monitoring and actuation  
- embedded control and networked controllers  
- integration of physical processes with software systems  

---

## Engineering Directions

Current and ongoing work includes:

- development of networked control systems  
- design of modular control architectures  
- integration of control logic with energy and measurement systems  
- validation of control performance through experimental feedback  

Concrete implementations and control configurations are documented in the
corresponding project repositories referenced in **[PROJECTS.md](../PROJECTS.md)**.

---

## Methodological Principles

- explicit modeling of system dynamics  
- systematic tuning and validation  
- reproducible control experiments  
- transparent documentation of control behavior  

---

## Open Questions

This section evolves as new control challenges emerge from ongoing projects and
experimental systems.

## References

Control theory references, technical documentation, and system design notes are
maintained alongside each concrete project.
