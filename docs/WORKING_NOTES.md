Open Physics Lab — Working Notes

Git & Workflow Quick Rules

Working on GitHub.com vs Local

Rule of thumb:

If you edited files on github.com, always run git pull** locally first** before doing anything else.

Typical Flow

If you worked locally:

Edit files

git add …

git commit -m "message"

git push

If you worked on github.com:

Open local repo

git pull

Continue working locally

Then commit & push

Why this matters

Mixing web edits and local edits without pulling first causes:

"fetch first" errors

diverged branches

confusing merge conflicts

Safe Fix When Confused

git status
git pull
git status

If in doubt: stop and pull first.

Grundregel (kurz)

👉 Jedes Softwareprojekt = eigenes Repository👉 Jede Gruppe = eigener Zugriff / eigene Organisation (optional)



(This file is for personal working notes and can grow over time.)

for coherent commit messages: 

A simple commit message style you can keep using

For future work, this pattern will keep everything consistent:

docs: …
structure: …
feature: …
fix: …
refactor: …
chore: …


Example:docs: add control system overview

feature: add MQTT heating controller prototype

structure: reorganize energy section

🧭 Reader’s Walkthrough: Does the structure make sense?

Imagine a new student or collaborator landing on your hub.

1️⃣ README.md (Hub root)

They should learn:

What Open Physics Lab is

That it’s an index & documentation hub

Where to find concrete projects

From what you’ve built: ✔️ yes

2️⃣ PROJECTS.md

They now want to see what actually exists.

They encounter:

Electrodynamics → concepts & experiments

Vortex / Fluids → experiments

Energy & Automation → real engineering projects

Systems Engineering → infrastructure

Control & Automation → methods

Then under Energy & Automation they see:

Heating controlFirmware (Portenta, C++)Automation / UI (Node-RED)…other energy systems (Node-RED)

So the reader already understands:

“Energy is the domain.Firmware & Node-RED are implementation layers.”

✔️ very clear

3️⃣ energy/README.md

They go deeper into Energy.

Now they read your new Implementation Model:

Heating = embedded + Node-RED

Everything else = Node-RED

Control & automation are documented elsewhere

This resolves the most common confusion immediately.

✔️ excellent

4️⃣ control/README.md

They want to understand how automation is done.

Now they see:

Control & Automation is a cross-cutting method layer

and:

Used by: Energy, Systems, experiments

This is exactly the right abstraction.

✔️ conceptually very strong

5️⃣ systems/README.md

They want to know how everything runs.

They see:

layered architecture

embedded → automation → infrastructure

Node-RED + Proxmox + Docker

Now the picture is complete.

✔️ full stack explained

🧩 Final verdict

Your hub now expresses three orthogonal dimensions:

DimensionWhere



Domain topics

energy/, electrodynamics/, etc.

Control methods

control/

Infrastructure

systems/

This is exactly how professional research labs document complex systems.

You now have:

clear separation of concerns

no duplication

no conceptual conflict

a structure that will scale for years
